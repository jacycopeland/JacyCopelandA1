Goals Completed:Create a Respository, set up dependecies, card and deck classes completed.

Important meathods:

Limitations: Cannot currently accept file input

Notes: player and game each only have one test file as it can be rerun with different inputs from the player.  Log of a game test shows that blackjack can be detected initially. I will try to submmit the log in the submission as well as include it here.  If it doesnt work I have a copy saved to my eclipse workspace as proof of detection.  Line 284 onwards shows a sucessful balckjack detection.  Anything before that is proof that cards are added and shuffled.
